// how # inlcude works?
// # includes means basically "copy-paste" the content of the file.
// after prorpocessor makes the copy-paste, the compiler will start the compilation.
#include "heehaw.hoohoo" // pre-processor will copy paste content of  file heehaw.hoohoo insterad of this line.
#include "hoohoo.txt" // pre-processor will copy paste content of  file hoohoo.txt insterad of this line.
